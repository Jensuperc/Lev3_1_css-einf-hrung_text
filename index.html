        <p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Oh, all
            right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Good news, everyone!
            There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</p>

        <p>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>

        <h2>Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</h2>

        <p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down
            the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. No. Throw her in the
            brig.</p>
